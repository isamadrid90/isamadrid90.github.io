# Mutating a Symfony project @ Symfonycon22

On November 18th I had the opportunity of being a speaker at [Symfonycon Disneyland](https://live.symfony.com/2022-paris-con/) although I would like to write more about what I explained in my talk, in the meantime, here are the slides and the projects that I used.

The slides are available [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFQDOnAsCQ/crRQ3QLLwaurnjKGCp06TA/view?utm_content=DAFQDOnAsCQ&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink)

To execute mutation testing on PHP I used Infection

%[https://infection.github.io/]

I created this GitHub project to show how we can include Infection in our Github Actions pipeline

That's all! Let me know if the topic and the resources are interesting to you so I could write more about it.
